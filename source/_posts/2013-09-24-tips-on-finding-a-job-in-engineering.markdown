## On the Hunt

Whether you're experienced or completely new to the world of engineering, finding that new job can be a daunting task. Either way, congratulations for getting this far!  

Having worked as a professional engineer for the past five years of my career, I've accumulated a few sources / websites that, when combined, have proven extremely useful. However, prior to the actual job hunt, **preparation** is absolutely everything.

## Preparation for the Uphill Battle

Here are a few tips I've found really helpful to know prior to starting the job hunt:  

- **Know what you want.**
	- The more specific your search criteria, the better.
	- Casting a wide net is good, but always remain focused.
	- Be realistic - go for jobs for which you are qualified to apply.
- **Know what you're worth.**
	- What are people in the position you're making normally make?
	- Are you an entry / senior level developer? What is your experience worth?
	- Does your cost of living play a factor?
- **Be prepared for interviewing, both behavioral and technical.**
	- Go over the typical behavioral interviewing questions.
		- Have answers to all of these before coming into the interview.
		- This should actually be the easiest part of the interview.
	- Review technical material and **practice** in expected formats (e.g. white-boarding).

With those things figured out, it's time to work on your presentation.

###RESUME

- Your resume needs to be the best it has ever been.
- This is a way for you to tell your story in a creative, professional way.
- Be **accurate** and only post **relevant information** for the job in question.
	- Resumes should be **tailored** for each job position.
- Be **specific** with details and **quantify** wherever possible.
- Hiring people normally spend 30-45 sec on your resume. **Make it count!**
- In many cases, it's recommended to have a matching **Cover Letter**.

###LINKEDIN PROFILE

- Your LinkedIn profile needs to be **accurate** and **polished**.
- LinkedIn Profile != Resume.
	- LinkedIn can and should house way more information than your resume.
	- They should both **tell the same story** in different formats.
- I'd recommend uploading a PDF version of your resume here.
- Invest the time in making this amazing... you never know!

Now that you're poised for success, onto resources that will aid in the quest for glory.

## Useful Resources

Here's a list of resources I've compiled over the years that help with finding jobs in engineering. If you find others, please let me know and I will add them to the list.

### Job Boards

This is my list of job boards / websites:

>**[INDEED](http://www.indeed.com)**

- Pings a variety of job search engines based on location and salary options.
- Keyword searches here are incredible at downsizing your job options.
- Use the 'sort by relevance / sort by date' feature tactically.

>**[DICE](http://www.dice.com)**

- Specifically for jobs in engineering & technology - great jobs on here.
- Much like Indeed, keyword searches here are your friend - be specific when possible.

>**[LINKEDIN](http://www.linkedin.com)**

- Has a variety of job postings, which many don't know.
- As stated in the previous section, invest the time into creating a good profile.

>**[GLASSDOOR](http://www.glassdoor.com)**

- Great lookup for company (1) satisfaction, (2) salary info, and (3) interview questions.
- Also a portal to many job requisitions, so be sure to look at those.

>**[MONSTER](http://www.monster.com)**

- Once you have your resume set, upload it to Monster.com and specify location of interest.
- You should start getting an influx of emails / phone calls from recruiters.
- This helped me in two ways: (a) great practice and (b) helped me figure out my "worth".

### Startup Sites

This is my list of startup websites:

>**[STARTUPLY](http://www.startuply.com)**

- This is an amazing resource for those interested in exploring startup jobs.
- Searching the database by city (location) will yield good results.

>**[INSIDE STARTUPS](http://www.insidestartups.org)**

- Another great resource for startups based on city (location).

>**[ANGEL LIST JOBS](https://angel.co/jobs)**

- Search for startups in your area based on city (location).
- By filling out the profile, companies may reach out to you.

>**[MADE IN NY](http://wearemadeinny.com/find-a-job/)**

- Awesome website specific to jobs in NYC startups.
- The Job Search page is amazing (e.g. sort by companies hiring.)

### Meetups / Networking

Wanted to spend some time here talking about Meetups and Networking.

Nothing beats 'old school' networking. Whether getting coffee, making a 'cold call', or sending an email expressing interest, it's up to you to do this. Sure, it may not be in your comfort zone, but you want that job, right? Stay confident and network!

One of my favorite ways of expanding my network is through attending programming meetups and hackathons. I recommend using **[MEETUP](http://www.meetup.com)** to help you with this.

## Closing Thoughts

Contrary to what many say, job hunting is a full time job in of itself. It takes a lot of time, energy, dedication, & determination. Hopefully, these resources will help on your conquest.
