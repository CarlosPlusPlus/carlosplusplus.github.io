## On the Hunt

Whether you're experienced or completely new to the world of engineering, finding that new job can be a daunting task. Either way, congratulations for getting this far!  

Having worked as a professional engineer for the past five years of my career, I've accumulated a few sources / websites that, when combined, have proven extremely useful. However, prior to the actual job hunt, **preparation** is absolutely everything.

## Preparation for the Uphill Battle

Here are a few tips I've found really helpful to know prior to starting the job hunt:  

- Know what you want.
	- The more specific your search criteria, the better.
	- Casting a wide net is good, but always remain focused.
	- Be realistic - go for jobs for which you are qualified to apply.
- Know what you're worth.
	- What are people in the position you're making normally make?
	- Are you an entry / senior level developer? What is your experience worth?
	- Does your cost of living play a factor?
- Be prepared for interviewing, both behavioral and technical.
	- Go over the typical behavioral interviewing questions.
		- Have answers to all of these before coming into the interview.
		- This should actually be the easiest part of the interview.
	- Review technical material and **practice** in expected formats (e.g. white-boarding).

With those things figured out, it's time to work on your presentation.

###RESUME

- Your resume needs to be the best it has ever been.
- This is a way for you to tell your story in a creative, professional way.
- Be **accurate** and only post **relevant information** for the job in question.
	- Resumes should be **tailored** for each job position.
- Be **specific** with details and **quantify** wherever possible.
- Hiring people normally spend 30-45 sec on your resume. **Make it count!**
- In many cases, it's recommended to have a matching **Cover Letter**.

###LINKEDIN PROFILE

- Your LinkedIn profile needs to be **accurate** and **polished**.
- LinkedIn Profile != Resume.
	- LinkedIn can and should house way more information than your resume.
	- They should both **tell the same story** in different formats.
- I'd recommend uploading a PDF version of your resume here.
- Invest the time in making this amazing... you never know!
