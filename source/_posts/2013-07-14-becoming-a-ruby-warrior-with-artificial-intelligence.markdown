In Weeks 3 - 6 at Flatiron School, the focus has been on learning both the Sinatra and Rails web frameworks. Understanding the paradigms has been crucial in spinning up web applications "the right way".  

However, it's important to remember the foundation on which these frameworks are built - the **Ruby** language. With only 6 weeks of Ruby knowledge under my belt, I want to continue understanding the principles of abstraction, modeling, and scope.  

Enter the realm of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

##Basic AI Principles

I've had the honor and pleasure of working with AI concepts in the Scheme programming language. I wanted to explore this realm in Ruby, and it turns out there's a great venue. Before I get into that, let me define two common terms used in AI:  

**Agent**: an autonomous entity which observes through sensors and acts upon an environment using actuators and directs its activity towards achieving goals.  

**Heuristic**: a function that ranks alternatives in various search algorithms at each branching step based on the available information in order to make a decision about which branch to follow during a search.  

Here's a cool image that will make these definitions clearer:
