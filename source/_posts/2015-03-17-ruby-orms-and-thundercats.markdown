Sincerest apologies for spending so much time away! Needed a break, and now with the mental batteries recharged, it's time to get back to it. Excuses are easy, so need to be better and more consistent with my technical writing and this blog.

Decided to try something completely new and made a ScreenCast almost two months ago regarding Ruby ORMs ([Object Relational Mappings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)) and [Thundercats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats_(1985_TV_series\)). Had a lot of fun doing this.

Here is a link to a GitHub gist that contains the code:
[thundercats.rb](https://gist.github.com/CarlosPlusPlus/b6497d90df7c79aa4b59)

Let me know what you think in the comments below.  

Looking forward to doing this again!
