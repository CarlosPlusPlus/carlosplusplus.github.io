On Thursday, June 6th, 2013, me and my current classmates here at the Flatiron School were given the unique opportunity to hear from Matt Hackett.

# Who is Matt Hackett?

Who is Matt Hackett you ask? Here's a brief summary from his **[website](http://matthackett.net/ "Website of Matt Hackett")**:

> I obsess over the engineering and dissemination of technology for creative people. 

---

>I'm happily torn between work on visible (marketing) and invisible (architecture, management) components of media-product-making machinery. 

---

>Most recently, I spent 2Â½ years at Tumblr as VP Engineering and later Head of Brand Strategy, as we grew the platform from a monthly audience of 25 million to 150 million people around the world.

And here's a picture of him at our own campus here at the Flatiron Schoo1:
