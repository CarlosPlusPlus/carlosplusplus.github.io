## **こんにちは世界** (Kon'nichiwa sekai!)

The inspiration for this blog post comes from a few places:

1. My love of languages and world-wide celebration of culture.
2. This [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/inouemak/ruby-and-japanesepdf) by [Makoto Inoue](https://twitter.com/makoto_inoue) on **Ruby and Japanese**.
3. General curiosity on the topic.

Growing up, my first **spoken** language was Spanish, followed shortly there after by English and French, all three of which I'm fluent in. In the present, I split my time between learning 5 other languages - Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, German, Italian, and Russian.  

Interestingly enough, during this same time period, I've also worked with a variety of different **programming** languages - C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Scheme, and MATLAB. I continue to learn languages, like Ruby, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.  

That begs me to ask the question:  

>-> **Is there a link between programming languages and spoken languages?** <-

Why yes, yes there is - let's take a look at **Ruby and the Japanese Language**.

## Insight into the Japanese Language

## How does this compare to Ruby

## Ruby in Japanese

## Embracing Language Diversity in the World

Too often, I overhear people argue over which language is:  

- Better.
- Faster.
- Stronger.
- More Robust.
- More Semantically Correct.

As programmers and as citizens of a diverse world, it's up to us to **respect** language in general, whether programming or spoken. It should come as no surprise that programming and spoken languages are so similar, _as one is used to express_ the other.
