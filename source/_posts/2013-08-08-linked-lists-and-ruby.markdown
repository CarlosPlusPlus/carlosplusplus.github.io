One of the most talked about data structures in Computer Science is the **Linked List**.  

So, what is a **Linked List** and how can we implement it in Ruby?

## What is a Linked List?

As defined by **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)**, a **Linked List** (LL) is:

> Data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

In the simplest implementation of a LinkedList, each node has the following:

> **value** = represents the value of the node (e.g. integer, Class, etc.)

> **next** = pointer to the next value in the sequence.

In addition,
