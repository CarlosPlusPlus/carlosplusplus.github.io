One of the things that has most fascinated me about the world of technology is our ability (and even sometimes, inability) to interact with computers. You hear about things like **[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Definition of Artificial Intelligence")**, self-realizations regarding the possibilities seen in the movie **[The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/)**, and prophecies of when **[SkyNet](http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Skynet)** will take over the world.  

Interestingly enough, this is where **HCI** comes into play.

## What is HCI?

Information TBD.

## Hacking the Microsoft Kinect

Information TBD.

## The Future is Now

My current plan is to explore the world of HCI via the Microsoft Kinect during my semester here at the Flatiron School. The exploration of this hardware interface, perhaps through gamification, will allow me to hopefully (1) contribute to open source and (2) understand the what is possible and what isn't.  

Simply stated:

>->**The possibilities are endless.**<-

Stay tuned for more information on the Kinect.
