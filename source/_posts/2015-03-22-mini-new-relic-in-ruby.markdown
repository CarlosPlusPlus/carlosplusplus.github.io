Another Ruby screencast coming your way!

One of the downsides to working at large companies (1000+ employees) is that is generally takes longer to get things done. My work colleague and I were interested in using [New Relic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Relic) to monitor the performance of our Rails applications in production, but the request was taking far too long and we were tired of waiting.

We took matters into our own hands and wrote a quick Ruby script, our mini version of New Relic, to give us insight into how our APIs were being used. It's easy to forget that while Rails can do a lot for us, the Ruby programming language itself is powerful and can be used to drum up quick prototypes and scripts for a variety of uses.

This is the quick and dirty script we came up with at work:

Here is a link to a GitHub gist that contains the code:

Hope you found this useful - until next time!
