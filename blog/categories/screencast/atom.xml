    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another Ruby screencast coming your way!</p>

<p>One of the downsides to working at large companies (1000+ employees) is that is generally takes longer to get things done. My work colleague and I were interested in using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Relic">New Relic</a> to monitor the performance of our Rails applications in production, but the request was taking far too long and we were tired of waiting.</p>

<p>We took matters into our own hands and wrote a quick Ruby script, our mini version of New Relic, to give us insight into how our APIs were being used. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that while Rails can do a lot for us, the Ruby programming language itself is powerful and can be used to drum up quick prototypes and scripts for a variety of uses.</p>

<p>This is the quick and dirty script we came up with at work:</p>

<p>Here is a link to a GitHub gist that contains the code:

<p>Hope you found this useful &ndash; until next time!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sincerest apologies for spending so much time away! Needed a break, and now with the mental batteries recharged, it&rsquo;s time to get back to it. Excuses are easy, so need to be better and more consistent with my technical writing and this blog.</p>

<p>Decided to try something completely new and made a ScreenCast almost two months ago regarding Ruby ORMs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object Relational Mappings</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats_(1985_TV_series)">Thundercats</a>. Had a lot of fun doing this.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think in the comments below.</p>

<p>Looking forward to doing this again!</p>
